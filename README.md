# Task-5-Capture-and-Analyze-Network-Traffic-Using-Wireshark.

Objective

To capture live network traffic and identify common internet protocols.

Tools Used

Wireshark (on Kali Linux)

Steps Followed

Launched Wireshark.

Started capture on eth0.

Visited several websites to generate traffic.

Stopped capture after 2 minutes.

Filtered packets by http, dns, and icmp protocols.

Exported capture as Objective

To capture live network traffic and identify common internet protocols.

Tools Used

Wireshark (on Kali Linux)

Steps Followed

Installed and launched Wireshark.

Started capture on wlan0.

Visited several websites and pinged google.com to generate traffic.

Stopped capture after 2 minutes.

Filtered packets by http, dns, and icmp protocols.

Exported capture as Objective

Steps Followed

Installed and launched Wireshark.

Started capture on wlan0.

Visited several websites and pinged google.com to generate traffic.

Stopped capture after 2 minutes.

Filtered packets by http, dns, and icmp protocols.

Exported capture as mycapture.pcap.

Observations

Most web traffic used TCP (port 80/443).

DNS requests occurred before HTTP connections.

ICMP packets confirmed network connectivity.

Outcome

Learned how to:

Capture live packets.

Identify major protocols.

Filter and analyze traffic using Wireshark..pcap.

Protocols Observed
Protocol	Description	Example Packet
HTTP	Web communication between client and server	GET /index.html request
DNS	Domain name to IP translation	Standard query A google.com
ICMP	Used for ping requests/replies	Echo request and Echo reply
